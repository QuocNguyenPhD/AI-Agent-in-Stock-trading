# AI-Agent-in-Stock-trading
We will explore and find the optimal policy for stock trading that relies on data from many different categories of stock.
Our goal is to explore many combinations of decision sell, buy, and hold through Q-Learning from there to get the best policies on trading stock. At the same time, we also find the data that is most relevant to the prediction. Then we will have a model that relies on less data for the best accuracy.
